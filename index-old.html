        <div class="steps-grid">
          <article class="step">
            <h3>1. Compatibility check & planning</h3>
            <p>
              We review your vehicle, driving patterns, and goals. You learn what the driver-assist system can and cannot do,
              and we confirm whether your car is a good candidate before booking an install.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article class="step">
            <h3>2. Professional system install on your vehicle</h3>
            <p>
              Our technicians install and wire the driver-assist system on your vehicle without defeating required safety equipment.
              We keep everything tidy, secure, and serviceable.
            </p>

          <article class="step">
            <h3>3. Calibration & test drive</h3>
            <p>
              We calibrate sensors and complete a controlled test drive, verifying stable operation under
              real road conditions around Austin.

            <p>
              You leave with hands-on training, clear safety guidelines, and access to optional support plans
              for updates, diagnostics, and future recalibration.

        <h2>What to expect on install day</h2>
        <p class="section-lead">
          We make install day as simple as possible: you drop your vehicle off, we handle the install and testing,
          and we bring your car back with the system installed and verified.
        </p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Drop off your vehicle & settle the balance.</strong>
            You arrive at your scheduled time, review the plan with us, and pay the remaining $1,500 for your install.
            The $1,500 deposit you already paid is applied toward your $3,000 total.</li>
          <li><strong>Ride home on us.</strong>
            After drop-off, we'll arrange an Uber or give you a ride back home or to work within the Austin metro area
            so you're not stuck waiting at the shop.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional install & initial calibration.</strong>
            Our technicians install the system on your vehicle, route and secure the harness, and perform the initial
            calibration and safety checks.</li>
          <li><strong>50–100 mile shakedown drive.</strong>
            We test drive your vehicle for roughly 50–100 miles under normal Austin driving conditions to confirm
            calibration, stability, and system behavior before we return it to you.</li>
          <li><strong>Delivery, training & handoff.</strong>
            Once everything checks out, we deliver your vehicle back to you with the system installed, walk you through
            how it works, and go over safety guidelines and limitations. You drive away in full control, with the system
            ready to assist.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="small-note">
          Plan on your vehicle being with us for most of the day. We'll confirm the exact timing and logistics when we
          schedule your install.

        <div class="faq-list">
          <details>
            <summary>Is this "self-driving"?</summary>
            <p>
              No. These systems provide advanced driver assistance – they help with steering and speed in certain
              conditions, but you must remain attentive and ready to take over at all times. You are always the driver.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Where do you operate?</summary>
            <p>
              We are currently focused on the Austin, Texas metro area. Driver-assist systems are installed on your vehicle at our local facility by
              appointment only.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What vehicles are compatible?</summary>
            <p>
              Compatibility depends on make, model, year, and condition. Start by checking our
              <a href="supported-vehicles.html">supported vehicles list</a>, then share your vehicle details in the booking form.
              We confirm compatibility before taking your deposit and scheduling a driver-assist system install on your vehicle.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Why do you require a $1,500 deposit?</summary>
            <p>
              The deposit lets us order the correct harness and parts for your specific vehicle and reserve shop time for your install.
              The $1,500 deposit is applied toward your total install cost.
              We confirm compatibility before sending a deposit link, so you are not asked to pay a deposit if your vehicle is not a good fit.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What happens if something goes wrong?</summary>
            <p>
              We design driver-assist system installs on your vehicle to be serviceable and reversible. If you experience issues, our support plan customers
              receive priority diagnostics, and we work to resolve problems promptly and safely.
