# Smoother Drive — Full Business Plan

---

## Executive Summary

Smoother Drive is building the premier brand for affordable, supervised driver-assist technology. We source high-quality OpenPilot-compatible hardware from Alibaba — including units with built-in navigation ($700–900/unit) — rebrand them under the Smoother Drive name, flash open-source OpenPilot software, and professionally install them in customers' vehicles. We launch in Austin, TX, bootstrapping out of the founder's garage with guerrilla marketing and PPC advertising.

- **Year 1 Goal:** 200 installs at $2,000 = **$400K revenue**
- **Year 3 Goal:** Expand to 50 franchises nationwide via $25K fees + 6% royalties, targeting **$5M+ system-wide revenue**
- **Startup Needs:** $10K seed round
- **Margins:** ~55–65% on hardware installs, plus recurring revenue from optional subscription
- **Market:** Booming ADAS aftermarket — $500B+ and growing 20% YoY

---

## Market Opportunity

- **US automotive aftermarket:** $500B+, with ADAS/CVT growing **20% YoY** (SEMA)
- **Competitor pricing gap:** Leading OEM driver-assist subscriptions charge **$100+/month** with mandatory fees just to use the system. Smoother Drive has **no required monthly fee** — you buy it, you own it.
- **Austin, TX:** Tech hub, 1M+ registered vehicles, heavy traffic congestion — perfect for guerrilla sign marketing: *"Traffic Sucks? Smoother Drive $2,000!"*
- **No direct franchise competitors** in this space; modeled after car audio/electronics install chains (e.g., Cleveland Soundwave: $500K Year 1 sales)
- **Consumer sentiment:** Consumer Reports rates OpenPilot above most OEM driver-assist systems
