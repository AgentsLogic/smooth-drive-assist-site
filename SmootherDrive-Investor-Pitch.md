# Smoother Drive — Investor Pitch

---

## Invest $1,000 for 1% Equity in a $400K Year 1 Driver-Assist Company

*Minimum $1,000 (1%) — up to $10,000 (10%) this round. Future rounds preserved.*

---

### The Problem

Leading OEM driver-assist systems cost **$8,000–$12,000+** and lock customers into **$100/month subscriptions** just to use features they already paid for. Traffic is brutal. Millions of drivers want affordable, reliable driver assistance — but the market offers nothing between "no assist" and "buy a new car."

---

### The Solution

**Smoother Drive** — a supervised driver-assist platform powered by OpenPilot (open-source, Consumer Reports top-rated), installed on premium rebranded hardware with **built-in navigation**. Professional installs for **$2,000**. No required monthly fee. Branded, franchisable, proven technology trained on **300M+ miles** of real-world driving data.

**Optional:** $80/month premium module — Wi-Fi for the car, additional cameras, and priority support.

---

### Traction Plan

- **Launch:** Austin, TX — guerrilla signs on Mopac & I-35 + PPC ads (*"Traffic Sucks? Smoother Drive — $2,000!"*)
- **Year 1:** 200 installs = **$400K revenue**, bootstrapped from founder's garage
- **Year 2:** LLC, certified mechanics, dedicated shop
- **Year 3:** Franchise to 50 shops nationwide = **$5M+ system-wide revenue**

---

### Market

- **$500B+** US automotive aftermarket
- ADAS segment growing **20% YoY**
- No required monthly fee — competitors charge $100+/month
- Undercut every competitor on price and accessibility

---

### The Ask

**$10,000 for 10% equity** — or invest as little as **$1,000 for 1%** (up to 10% max this round).

Future funding rounds preserved for growth-stage capital.

---

### Why Now?

- OEM driver-assist subscriptions are frustrating consumers — $100+/month with no ownership
- OpenPilot is free, open-source, and battle-tested (300M+ miles)
- No one is franchising aftermarket ADAS installs — **first mover advantage**
- Austin is the perfect launchpad: tech-savvy, car-heavy, traffic-heavy
- Founder is ready to install Day 1 — zero overhead, maximum speed

---

### Revenue Streams

1. **Device + Installation** — $2,000 per install (core)
2. **Shipped Device + Harness** — for remote/DIY customers
3. **Harness Sales** — marked up per vehicle model
4. **Premium Module** — $80/month (Wi-Fi, cameras, premium support)
